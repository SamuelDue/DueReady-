## üìç **RECOMMENDED PLACEMENT LOCATIONS**

### 1. **Homepage - "Who We Are" Section** (HIGH IMPACT)
**Current:** Abstract text only
**Recommended:** Add 2-3 professional headshots or team working shots
```
[Image Layout Suggestion]
- Left: Professional headshot of founder/key person
- Right: Text about collective/expertise
- Or: Small grid of diverse professional headshots (3-4 people)
```

### 2. **Experts Page Enhancement** (MEDIUM IMPACT)
**Current:** One real expert + placeholder cards
**Recommended:** Add professional stock photos to placeholder cards
```
[Implementation]
- Keep Samuel's real photo
- Replace "Coming Soon" placeholders with diverse professional stock photos
- Use consistent styling/filters to make them cohesive
```

### 3. **Contact Page** (MEDIUM IMPACT)
**Current:** No human imagery
**Recommended:** Add small team photo or single professional shot
```
[Placement]
- In the "What to Expect" section
- Or small circular headshot next to contact info
- Shows "you'll be talking to real people"
```

### 4. **Services Pages** (LOW-MEDIUM IMPACT)
**Current:** Text-heavy with abstract backgrounds
**Recommended:** Add relevant professional working shots
```
[Examples]
- Financial services: Person reviewing documents
- Legal services: Professional consultation scene
- Tech services: Person at computer/reviewing systems
```
